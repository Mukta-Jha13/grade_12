        <h3>Data: </h3>
        <p>In computing, data is information translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing. Relative to today's computers and transmission media, data is information converted into binary digital form. It is acceptable to use data as a singular subject or a plural subject. Raw data is a term that describes data in its most basic digital format.</p>

        <p>The concept of data in the context of computing has its roots in the work of Claude Shannon, an American mathematician known as the father of information theory. He ushered in binary digital concepts based on applying two-value Boolean logic to electronic circuits. Binary digit formats underlie the CPUs, semiconductor memories and disk drives, as well as many of the peripheral devices common in computing today. Early computer input for control and data took the form of punch cards, followed by magnetic tape and the hard disk.</p>

        <p>Early on, data's importance in business computing became apparent by the popularity of the terms data processing and electronic data processing, which, for a time, encompassed the full gamut of what is now known as information technology. Over the history of corporate computing, specialization occurred, and a distinct data profession emerged along with growth of corporate data processing.</p>

        <h3>Information: </h3>
        <p>Information is the output that results from analyzing, contextualizing, structuring, interpreting or in other ways processing data. Information infuses meaning and value into the data. It facilitates understanding, communication and learning, and is a key factor in system designs and strategic planning, as well as in problem-solving and decision-making. Information brings context to the data, turning what would otherwise be meaningless content into something comprehensible and usable.</p>

        <h4>Features of information: </h4>
        <p>Accuracy: Free from errors.</p>
        <p>Timeliness: Available when needed.</p>
        <p>Relevance: Useful for the purpose.</p>
        <p>Completeness: Contains all necessary details.</p>
        <p>Consistency: Uniform across systems.</p>
        <p>Understandability: Easily comprehensible.</p>

     <div class="database">
        <h3>Database: </h3>
        <p>A database is an electronically stored, systematic collection of data that can include words, numbers, images, videos, and other types of files. Databases are managed using specialized software called a Database Management System (DBMS), which allows users to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. Databases are the backbone of modern applications, supporting businesses, organizations, and systems across industries.</p>
        <h4>Purposes of database</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Store large volumes of data efficiently</li>
        <li>Enable quick retrieval and manipulation</li>
        <li>Maintain data integrity and security</li>
        <li>Support multi-user access</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="terminologies">
        <h3>Terminologies in database: </h3>
        <p>Table: A collection of related data organized in rows and columns.</p>
        <p>Field (Attribute): A column in a table representing a data type.</p>
        <p>Record (Row/Tuple): A single entry in a table, consisting of fields.</p>
        <p>Tuple: Synonym for a record; a single data item in a relation.</p>
        <p>Object: An instance of a class in object-oriented databases; data plus behavior.</p>
        <p>Keys: Unique identifiers used to access records (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Candidate Key).</p>
        <p>Data dictionary: The data dictionary consists of two words, data, which represents data collected from several sources, and dictionary, which represents where this data is available. The data dictionary is an important part of the relational database because it provides additional information about the relationship between several tables in the database. A data dictionary in a DBMS helps users manage data in an orderly and orderly manner, thereby preventing data redundancy.</p>
